excerpt: >
I'm Kedma Hamelberg, an applied AI scientist in marketing and society. I use NLP, machine learning, deep learning, and AI agents to analyze how brands and CEOs shape public discourse—from war and sustainability to DEI.

  My work appears in the *Journal of Public Policy & Marketing* and leading conferences like EMAC and AMS. I teach applied AI for marketing and digital strategy in business master’s programs.
