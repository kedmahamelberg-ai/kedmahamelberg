excerpt: >
I'm Kedma Hamelberg, an applied AI scientist working at the intersection of marketing, business, and society. AI is both my method and my object of study: methodologically, I apply NLP, machine learning, deep learning, and AI agents to analyze public discourse; conceptually, I examine how AI technologies reshape consumer behavior, business strategy, and societal norms.

My research appears in the *Journal of Public Policy & Marketing* and is presented at top conferences such as EMAC and AMS. I teach Digital Marketing & Analytics and Applied AI for Marketing to diverse master’s cohorts in Business Administration.
