excerpt: >
  I’m Kedma Hamelberg, an applied AI scientist focused on the drivers of digital communication.
  My research integrates natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning, and AI agents 
  with predictive and causal inference to analyze how brands, CEOs, and citizens shape public discourse, especially 
  during critical contexts from war to AI.

  My research has been published in the *Journal of Public Policy & Marketing* and presented at EMAC and AMS. 
  I bring these insights into the classroom, where I teach Applied AI for Marketing and Digital Analytics 
  to diverse MSc cohorts in business administration.



  I'm currently on the job market for a tenure-track position and am open to research collaborations and 
  AI-powered education partnerships.
