I develop **explainable AI systems** that predict how consumers respond to marketing in digital environments—analyzing 13+ million social media posts to understand what drives engagement, emotion, and action.

My research combines **machine learning, natural language processing, and causal inference** to decode brand communication during critical moments: from consumer behavior towards AI to CEO messaging during war. Published in the *Journal of Public Policy & Marketing* and presented at EMAC and AMS, my work bridges computational social science and marketing strategy.

I translate these insights into the classroom, teaching **Applied AI for Marketing** and **Digital Marketing Analytics** to MSc students (rated 4.9/5.0). My courses equip future marketers with hands-on skills in Python, machine learning, and AI-powered consumer analytics.

**Currently seeking tenure-track positions** in marketing, digital analytics, or computational social science. Open to research collaborations and AI education partnerships.
