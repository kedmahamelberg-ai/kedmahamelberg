excerpt: >
  I’m Kedma Hamelberg, an applied AI scientist focused on marketing, business, and societal impact. My research integrates natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning, and AI agents with predictive and causal inference to analyze how brands and CEOs shape public discourse, especially during moments of crisis, from war and sustainability to DEI.

My work is published in the Journal of Public Policy & Marketing and has been presented at EMAC and AMS. I bring these insights into the classroom, where I teach Applied AI for Marketing and Digital Strategy to diverse MSc cohorts in business administration.

I'm currently on the job market for a tenure-track position and open to research collaborations and AI-powered education partnerships.
