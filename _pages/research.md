## Research 

I develop explainable AI methods to predict consumer behavior in digital environments. My work combines large-scale social media analytics **(analyzing 13+ million posts)** with econometric rigor to understand how marketing communication drives engagement, emotion, and action.

## Research Streams
### 1. AI-Powered Marketing Communication Analytics
I create hybrid AI classification systems that balance predictive power with interpretability—critical for marketing applications where managers need actionable insights, not black boxes. My methodological contributions include:

Domain-specialized transformer models combining large language model embeddings with rule-based validation layers
Multimodal analysis of text, emojis, and visual content across digital platforms
Scalable NLP pipelines for sentiment, emotion, stance, and moral language detection

**Key findings**: Symbol emojis (🏳️‍🌈 for inclusivity) increase SDG message engagement by 281% while icon emojis show no effect. CEO communication generates stronger public engagement than brand accounts during geopolitical crises. When brands maintain their DEI commitments while supporters are vocal on social media, they gain more consumer engagement and purchase intentions than when they abandon DEI while critics are vocal—standing firm with supporters beats retreating from critics.

### 2. Consumer Responses to AI Technologies
Collaborating with researchers at iaelyon and Emlyon Business School, I analyze shifting human-AI relationships using change-point detection across millions of social media conversations. This line of research examines:

How consumers perceive and respond to AI agents in marketing contexts
The role of humor in shaping attitudes toward AI automation
Evolving assemblages between humans and artificial intelligence in digital ecosystems
