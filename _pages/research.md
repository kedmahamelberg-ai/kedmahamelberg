## Research Focus

My research examines how brands and CEOs communicate during societal crises—and how audiences respond emotionally, politically, and behaviorally. I explore corporate messaging in polarized environments using **AI-powered methods**, with the goal of understanding what drives engagement, support, or backlash.

In today’s sociopolitical climate, corporate silence can be seen as complicity, while speaking up may trigger division. My work investigates how message **source** (e.g., CEO vs. brand), **style** (e.g., emotional tone, symbolism, emoji use), and **context** (e.g., political polarization, social crises) shape audience reactions on digital platforms.

My dissertation, *Voices in Action: AI-Powered Insights from Corporate Messaging During Societal Crises*, bridges marketing, political psychology, and computational social science. It includes three studies that apply advanced **AI and NLP techniques** to analyze more than 380,000 real-world social media interactions:

---

### Article 1 – Emojis & SDG Messaging  
Draws on **Media Richness Theory** and uses fine-tuned deep learning transformer models to classify emoji types in brand communication about the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), revealing that concrete visuals increase engagement.
  → Accepted for EMAC 2025 and AMS 2025

### Article 2 – CEO Voice During War  
Applies **machine learning-based emotion classification** and **framing analysis** to show that CEO messages during the Russia–Ukraine war outperform brand messages in driving public engagement—especially when emotionally expressive (Executive Symbolism Theory).
  → Published in *Journal of Public Policy & Marketing*

### Article 3 – Corporate Stances in Divided Times  
Examines how shifts in corporate positioning on sensitive societal topics influence public reactions across ideological lines. Using advanced AI text analytics and causal inference techniques, this study uncovers how audiences interpret and emotionally respond to perceived inconsistencies in brand commitments during moments of societal tension.

### AI Techniques & Analytics Methods I Use

- Zero-shot and fine-tuned **transformer models** (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa)
- **Sentiment, emotion, stance, and moral language classifiers**
- Human-in-the-loop **AI agents** for classification and content generation
- **Multimodal analysis** across text, emojis, and platform-specific engagement
- Causal inference via **Difference-in-Differences**, **Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS)**, and OLS regression
- Experimental design using **AI-generated stimuli** for field or lab testing
- Multi-agent chatbot framework to simulate persuasive brand-consumer interactions in controlled experiments
- Role-specific agents (e.g., sentiment adjuster, content rewriter, ethical watchdog) for dynamic message generation

### Purpose

By combining **AI methods with theoretical rigor**, my research provides actionable insights for scholars and practitioners on how to navigate the risks and rewards of public-facing brand communication, especially during high-stakes societal moments.
