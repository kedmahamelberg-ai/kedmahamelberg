üìö Teaching Philosophy & Courses
I teach with the belief that digital marketing education should combine cutting-edge theory, hands-on AI tools, and real-world business cases to equip students for today's data-driven, ethically conscious marketplace.

My courses are grounded in three pillars:

Applied AI for Marketing 

Digital Marketing & Analytics (DMA) 

Ethical, Societal, and Behavioral Implications of Data & Technology


**Applied AI for Marketing (Master's Elective)**
This elective empowers students to navigate, deploy, and critically assess AI within the marketing landscape. The course is designed around three AI literacies:

Rhetorical AI literacy: How AI-generated content persuades and performs

Key Features:
Python-based tutorials in Google Colab

Hands-on analysis with YouTube, website, and social media data

Deep learning applications (e.g., transformers for text & image classification)

Business case collaboration (e.g., Danone, OHRA, Lucid Motors)

Capstone group project: Develop an AI-powered strategy using AI systems for scraping, classification, and predictive/causal modeling.
