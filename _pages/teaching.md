## Teaching Philosophy & Experience

I approach teaching as an evidence-based, student-centered practice grounded in the power of **education, human connection**, and **applied learning**. My classrooms are designed to foster intellectual rigor, collaboration, and long-term professional value.

I intentionally learn my students’ names, actively engage them in discussion, and cultivate peer connection as a resource—both for navigating the course and as a source of **lifelong career support**.

My goal is to prepare students—whether full-time learners or working professionals—for the realities of today’s data-driven, ethically complex marketing landscape.

### My teaching spans:

- Designing new courses from scratch  
- Redesigning and coordinating existing programs  
- Delivering lectures and interactive tutorials  
- Supervising Master’s theses and mentoring career transitions

### Courses taught:

- **Applied AI for Marketing** (Master’s Elective)  
- **Digital Marketing & Analytics (DMA)** – Core course for both full-time and Executive Master’s students  
- **Quantitative Data Analysis 2** (Bachelor’s, Economics)

This course trains students to critically assess and deploy AI in marketing contexts. It is structured around three core literacies:

- **Functional AI literacy**: How AI works, conceptually and practically  
- **Ethical AI literacy**: How to navigate the ethical issues related to AI (e.g., Fairness, bias, transparency, and responsible use)  
- **Rhetorical AI literacy**: How natural language and AI-generated content persuades and performs

### Key Features

- Python-based tutorials in Google Colab  
- Deep learning models (e.g., BERT, transformers for text and image classification)  
- Business data from YouTube, websites, and social media  
- Predictive and causal modeling (e.g., DiD, logistic/linear regression)  
- Tutorials on single, multi-agent, and agentic AI  
- Live debates on political polarization, fairness, and explainability in AI  
- Collaborations with businesses to solve real challenges (e.g., Danone, OHRA, and Lucid Motors)

### Sample Student Exercises
