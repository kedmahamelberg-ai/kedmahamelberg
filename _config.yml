description: >-
  I’m Kedma Hamelberg, an applied AI scientist focused on marketing, business, and societal impact. My research integrates natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning, and AI agents with predictive and causal inference to analyze how brands and CEOs shape public discourse during crises—ranging from war and sustainability to DEI. My work is published in the Journal of Public Policy & Marketing and has been presented at EMAC and AMS. I bring this expertise into the classroom, where I teach applied AI for marketing and digital strategy to diverse master’s cohorts in business administration. If you’re seeking research-driven insights or AI-powered education partnerships, let’s connect (kedma@hamelberg-ai.com).
